# Line Counter Snapshot Tool

A small, slightly overengineered line counter that tracks how your project grows over time.

It scans the current folder, counts lines for selected source files, saves a
**snapshot** to a local SQLite database, and shows the history in a GUI
with two tabs:

- **Snapshots** – text view of each snapshot with totals and per-file stats.
- **Graph** – horizontal bar chart per file showing how much was added or removed.

## Credits

- Code written by **ChatGPT** (GPT-5.1 Thinking).
- Human supervisor, button-clicker, and chaos director: **Coverfish**.
- Coverfish claims:

  which makes this even more fun.

## What it does

On every run, `linecounter.py`:

1. Looks at all files in the **same folder** as itself.
2. Counts:
   - **Total lines**
   - **Non-empty lines**
3. Saves a **snapshot** of those counts into `line_history.db` (SQLite).
4. Only creates a new snapshot if **something actually changed** since the last one
   (no useless duplicates).
5. Opens a GUI window with two tabs:

### Snapshots tab

- Shows every snapshot with:
  - Per-file:
    - total lines
    - non-empty lines
    - percentage of lines that are non-empty
  - Project totals at the bottom.
- Newest snapshot is shown **at the top**.
- The **last snapshot of each calendar day** is marked with a big blue weekday label  
  (e.g. `FRIDAY`) next to the header.

### Graph tab

- Horizontal **bar chart** per file for the currently selected snapshot.
- Colors:
  - **Blue** = baseline lines from the previous snapshot  
    (or current snapshot if it’s the very first one).
  - **Red** = **new lines added** in the current snapshot.
  - **Green** = **lines removed** compared to the previous snapshot.
- Shows project totals at the top:
  - total lines (including empty)
  - total non-empty lines
- Scrollbar if you have lots of files.
- Navigation:
  - **F1** → Snapshots tab  
  - **F2** → Graph tab  
  - **▲ / Up** → newer snapshot  
  - **▼ / Down** → older snapshot

## Which files are counted?

Right now, these extensions are included:

```python
SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = {".py", ".c", ".h", ".cpp", ".hpp"}
That means it will count:

Python: .py

C: .c

C headers: .h

C++: .cpp

C++ headers: .hpp

It also ignores linecounter.py itself so the tool doesn’t bloat its own stats.

If you want to support more file types, just edit SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS in
linecounter.py and add whatever extensions you like:

python
Copy code
SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = {".py", ".c", ".h", ".cpp", ".hpp", ".js", ".ts", ".rs"}
Requirements
Python 3.10+ (older 3.x will likely be fine too).

Standard library only:

pathlib

sqlite3

tkinter

On some Linux distros you might need to install tkinter manually, e.g.:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install python3-tk
No extra pip install needed.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Coverfish/line-counter.git
cd line-counter
(Optional) Test if tkinter works:

bash
Copy code
python -m tkinter
If a small demo window appears, you’re good.

Usage
Put linecounter.py into the root folder of the project you want to track
(or leave it there and move your code into the same folder).

Run:

bash
Copy code
python linecounter.py
On each run, it will:

Count lines in all files with supported extensions.

Compare to the last snapshot stored in line_history.db.

Create a new snapshot only if something changed (files added/removed or line counts changed).

Open the GUI so you can browse snapshots and the graph.

The file line_history.db is created in the same folder as linecounter.py.

License / “Legal stuff” (kind of)
This project is basically:

Free to use in any way you see fit.

You can:

Copy it

Modify it

Use it in personal or commercial projects

Sacrifice it to the refactoring gods

There is no warranty of any kind. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

Also:

If you somehow manage to eat the code, go ahead.
(Maybe don’t, but I can’t stop you.)

If you want a more official label, you can mentally treat this as:

“Public domain / do whatever you want”.

Why?
Because:

Counting lines by hand is boring.

Watching your project grow in snapshots is kinda satisfying.

Coverfish wanted something small and it escalated (as projects tend to do).

And ChatGPT likes turning “quick scripts” into tiny weird apps.

Enjoy 🎉
